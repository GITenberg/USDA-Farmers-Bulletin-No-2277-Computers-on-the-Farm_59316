<p>How can a computer help you operate your farm better?</p>

<p>How do you select useful computer programs (software) and
equipment (hardware)?</p>

<p>If you have a computer or plan to get one, what information can
you obtain with your computer that will be useful for your farm
operation?</p>

<p>This publication will help you answer such questions. It will help
you evaluate and select a new system, or get more out of the one you
already have.</p>

<p>The key components of computer systems you may want to know
about are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Hardware&mdash;the physical equipment itself.</li>

<li>Software&mdash;the computer programs on tape or disk, and</li>

<li>Online sources of information&mdash;such as current market and
weather information and technical reports.</li>

</ul>

<p>This publication offers guidelines to help farmers select hardware,
software, and online information. (See the <a href="#Glossary">glossary</a> at the end of this
publication for definitions of specialized computer terms.)</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="What_a_Computer_Can_Do_for_You" id="What_a_Computer_Can_Do_for_You"><b>What a Computer Can Do for You</b></a></p>


<p>You can use a microcomputer to help you&mdash;</p>

<p>Determine the most economical feed ration for dairy cows and
other farm animals.</p>

<p>Schedule irrigation,</p>

<p>Get quick access to records,</p>

<p>Keep machinery inventories and depreciation schedules,</p>

<p>Help with tax records and making out income tax returns,</p>

<p>Keep livestock breeding and production records,</p>

<p>Keep a record of loans and cash flow to meet interest and
principal payments,</p>

<p>Determine levels of earnings by working through a profit and loss
statement and by calculating a percentage return to capital and a
percentage return to equity,</p>

<p>Decide the optimum production choice for a particular farm in a
given year, and the optimum combination of inputs to grow the crops
or livestock chosen,</p>

<p>Store large amounts of data, and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span></p>

<p>Get current market and weather information if the microprocessor
is connected via the telephone to data bases (see section on online
services).</p>

<p>Software programs are also available in such areas as financial
management, crop and field records, mailing lists for customers of
certified seed and breeding stock, machinery purchase versus custom
hiring, investment feasibility of building and livestock facilities,
commodity price charts and tables, income taxation, marketing, soil
conservation, and integrated pest management.</p>

<p>The computer and its associated software packages can help you
do four kinds of work: (1) store and manipulate records, (2) provide
analyses for management decisions, (3) control machines or monitor
production, and (4) communicate faster with other people through
their computers and data bases.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Recordkeeping" name="Recordkeeping"></a><b>Recordkeeping</b></p>

<p>Many experts recommend that you start on a small scale, computerize
one thing at a time, and learn as you go along&mdash;rather than trying
to put information on your entire farm operation into the computer all
at once. A good place to start is with farm records.</p>

<p>You can use microcomputers to keep track of financial records&mdash;such
as cash flow, bank balances, accounts payable, accounts
receivable, net worth statements, costs, and returns&mdash;as well as
other records&mdash;such as livestock breeding and production reports,
crop and field records, and mailing lists.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Farm_Management_Analysis" name="Farm_Management_Analysis"></a><b>Farm Management Analysis</b></p>

<p>After computerizing the farm records, the next step would be to
do simple analyses on the microprocessor. A good place to start is by
analyzing data already stored in the computer or available in the files.</p>

<p>For example, you could use the recordkeeping capabilities of the
computer to record and depreciate equipment, and to decide whether
it is cheaper to lease or buy farm equipment.</p>

<p>General software is available to help you with accounting and
bookkeeping, basic business functions.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Process_Controllers" name="Process_Controllers"></a><b>Process Controllers</b></p>

<p>Besides analyzing farm management problems and storing data,
computers have another key use&mdash;as process controllers. They can
control such devices as pumps and gates, record milk output per cow,
and control grain drying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span></p>

<p>To save water and energy, some farmers have switched to
sophisticated irrigation scheduling by programing their computers to
read the moisture in the soil, the weather, and the humidity, and to
provide information on a plant's age and irrigation needs. The computer
then tells the farmer when to water a crop and for how long&mdash;and
can even turn the water on and off.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Telecommunications" name="Telecommunications"></a><b>Telecommunications</b></p>

<p>You can also use a computer as an up-to-date source for
communication, linking you to banks of information that are available
almost instantaneously from public and private online information
sources. With the computer hooked up to the telephone, you can get
information quickly, receive it visually, and record it in detail if you
wish.</p>

<p>Some key information sources are listed on <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a> of this bulletin.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Other_Uses" name="Other_Uses"></a><b>Other Uses</b></p>

<p>Farm families can use microcomputers the same way other
families do&mdash;to plan the family budget, keep an inventory of
household furnishings, keep track of recipes, keep mailing lists, turn
lights and heat on and off, type homework and other documents, learn
new skills, and play games.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Computers_on_the_Farm" id="Computers_on_the_Farm"><b>Computers on the Farm</b></a></p>


<p>Most of the computers farmers are getting are microcomputers,
also called home computers or personal computers. They are the basis
of the "computer revolution" that has been occurring since the late
1970's and they are the focus of this publication.</p>

<p>Many farmers, especially the owners of the larger farms, already
have computers. But you don't have to be a large farmer to afford a
microcomputer. Computers can be useful in almost all areas of a
farming operation&mdash;helping you decide what, when, and how to plant;
how to sell; and how to arrange the farm business to be more efficient
and more profitable.</p>

<p>The computer can supplement the calculator, typewriter, and file
cabinet. And it can send and receive written or graphic messages by
telephone (in most areas of the country) that might be too long or
complex to do verbally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span></p>

<p>A computer can be very useful when repetitive analyses are
needed or when data storage is important, as with financial records or
daily milk output per cow.</p>

<p>More and more, farming requires sophisticated management
decisions and management of basic resources, including land, water,
labor, production inputs, and capital. These are the kinds of decisions
the computer can help you make faster and more cost-effectively.</p>

<p>Although a computer program for your farm operation could
make recordkeeping and analysis easier and improve your ability to
manage, it might be hard to measure these improvements in dollars.
But the dollars you save by having better information on when to sell a
crop, how to monitor the business, and how to diagnose a problem
before it gets out of control might pay for the computer. Farmers and
ranchers with large feedlot or other livestock operations might find that
a feed formulation program could cut costs enough to pay for the
computer system within a few months.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="How_to_Choose_a_Microcomputer_System" id="How_to_Choose_a_Microcomputer_System"><b>How to Choose a Microcomputer System</b></a></p>


<p>Should you buy a microcomputer? How do you decide on a
system that's best for you? Here are some factors to consider in
making these decisions.</p>

<p>The first step is to think about your needs. What would you do
with your computer system? How would you actually use it to help
you run your operation better? List your primary needs, the important
things you want to do right away with your computer. Then, think of
secondary needs&mdash;things you might do in the future once you have a
computer.</p>

<p>Once you've identified your needs, the next step is to shop
around&mdash;to find some software that fulfills your needs and to see some
systems in operation. Go to computer stores or get in touch with the
salespeople in your area. You could decide to have custom programs
written for your operation, but they will be significantly more
expensive than programs that have already been developed.</p>

<p>Talk to other farmers, ranchers, extension and university
specialists, and business people who are using microcomputers. Find
out what software they are using. Do some research (by reading books
or magazines, taking a course or seminar, or visiting a trade show) so
you'll be an informed customer when you shop seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span></p>

<p>Many computer experts strongly recommend against buying a
computer first and then shopping for the software packages. So
identify your needs and select the software packages or materials that
will help you do what you want to with your computer. Then find the
hardware to run the programs.</p>

<p class="caption3"><b>The Computer Revolution</b></p>

<p>"The advent of computers to farm management ... is
already underway and seems likely to have a powerful
influence," said USDA historian Wayne Rasmussen in 1982.
"The computer should lead to more efficient management of
machines and energy and should help in other farming
operations such as cost accounting, mixing feed rations and
applying fertilizers and other resources efficiently. Some farmers
now have computers of their own, and many others have access
to computer systems through their county agricultural agents,"
Rasmussen pointed out.</p>

<p>The computer can be seen as the "third revolution" in
American farming. The first revolution was the use of the horse,
which added animal power to human power. The second was
the switch from the horse to the tractor, which again expanded
the power an individual could wield. But the computer is a
different kind of technological advance because it adds to the
farmer's power to manage.</p>

<p>By 1990, the computer will probably be as important a part
of a commercial farmer's operation as the pickup truck. Farmers
may flip on their computers first thing in the morning&mdash;instead of
their radios&mdash;to get the latest market prices. They can get a
rundown on weather and growing conditions for major
worldwide production areas; pertinent data on prices, market
conditions, credit terms, transportation and storage rates, and
related forecasts; and finally a list of priorities each day to take
advantage of these conditions.</p>

<p>Getting the right system&mdash;the combination of hardware (the
physical equipment) and software (the computer programs)&mdash;is
the problem farmers must solve before they can make the most
of the computer revolution.</p>

</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Strategies_for_Getting_Into_Computers" id="Strategies_for_Getting_Into_Computers"><b>Strategies for Getting Into Computers</b></a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span></p>

<p>If you're interested in getting your farm's operations
computerized, and you're just starting, you could choose various
strategies for doing so. One way is to first buy the basic hardware and
components you think you need, and then add memory and other
components later. If you do that, be sure you can add additional disk
drives, memory, and a printer to your computer, all at a reasonable
cost.</p>

<p>What can you do with a small computer once you outgrow it, and
you want to get a bigger one? You might want to use your older
computer in a small, specialized farm operation, or keep it to retrieve
and analyze records that you stored on the old equipment. Other
alternatives would be to trade it in on a larger computer, advertise to
sell it through the local want-ads, trade or sell it to a friend or neighbor,
keep the small computer for someone else in the family (perhaps a
game-playing youngster), or donate it to a local school or religious or
charitable group and take a tax write-off.</p>

<p>The farm of the future may have many computers, some for
specific functions such as irrigation scheduling or dairy operations, and
one for financial records. Having several computers would help
farmers deal with the problem of malfunctioning computers, so that
the whole farm would not be shut down if one computer goes down.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Alternatives_to_Buying_a_Microcomputer" id="Alternatives_to_Buying_a_Microcomputer"><b>Alternatives to Buying a Microcomputer</b></a></p>


<p>You might consider alternatives to buying a computer. You may
be able to lease one to see what it will do for you, and use it until your
needs make it worthwhile to buy one. Prices keep coming down. The
best time to buy is when you find you can profitably make use of a
computer. Even though it becomes technically obsolete, it will still do
for you what you purchased it for.</p>

<p>A programmable calculator may be an appropriate tool that is
much less costly then a microcomputer.</p>

<p>If you like what a computer can do for your operation but aren't
ready to buy one or to use it yourself, you might hire a consultant to
help you select an appropriate system. Or you might retain an
accountant or computer consultant to run the financial analysis
programs you need. This kind of service gives quick results, and
relieves you of having to do it yourself.</p>

<p>State Cooperative Extension Services are helping States provide
computers for county offices. Many State Extension Services already
have computers in nearly every county Extension office.</p>

<p>If you are considering buying or leasing a computer system, or
want software or timesharing services to make the most of the system
you have, a good place to go is to your State or county Extension
office. In many States, county Extension offices have terminals
connecting them to mainframe computers; some have
microcomputers which give them access to information on crop
management, animal production, and marketing.</p>

<p>The county Extension staff can tell you what is available online in
your area that is tailored to your kind of farming and your region. The
Extension staff will also be able to tell you the software programs
applicable in your State. Many State Extension offices have
publications on computers, and others have or are developing online
information networks linking farmers and other users to the State
university mainframe computer and its data base.</p>

<p>State Extension specialists are a logical place to start when looking
for software that is appropriate to your needs. Many State Extension
computer and agricultural experts have produced software materials
that are available, and the county agent will know about them.</p>

<p>In some cases the county Extension office can lend you software.
If you don't have a computer, the Extension office may be able to run
programs for you, choosing the appropriate software available and
plugging in the precise conditions and problems on your farming or
ranching operation. Or they may be able to use the computer to
search for information you need, perhaps communicating with a large
State, regional, or national data base.</p>

<p>As lower cost computers with improved software have become
available, an increasing number of people are turning to their State
Cooperative Extension Services for training in computer fundamentals,
equipment selection, and software evaluation. County agents can help
people find what is available, but they probably will not be preparing
software programs themselves.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="How_to_Select_Software" id="How_to_Select_Software"><b>How to Select Software</b></a></p>


<p>The key criteria for selecting good software are the following:
Does it meet your needs? Does it do what it says it will do? And does it
have good support documentation?</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Checklist_for_Evaluating_Software" name="Checklist_for_Evaluating_Software"></a><b>Checklist for Evaluating Software</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span></p>

<p>Here are some factors to consider when evaluating and
comparing software:</p>

<p><b>Documentation.</b> Look at the "documentation" or the written
(paper) materials that come with your program. These should explain
clearly what the program does and what you have to do to use it.</p>

<p><b>Ease of Use.</b> Is the program fairly easy to use? Does it guide you
through the program?</p>

<p><b>Instructions.</b> Another factor you should consider in evaluating
software is the instructions. Are there instructions in the program or in
the written documentation? Are they readable? You should be sure you
understand how to operate the program.</p>

<p><b>Help.</b> What help can you get if you run into problems? Does the
program have a "help" function? When you don't know how to
answer a question or need help, can you turn to a separate part of the
computer program or to a part of the accompanying documentation to
answer your question? Is there a company phone-in service you can
call if you need help?</p>

<p>Some software programs may come to you with bugs (errors) in
them. Find out what backup services are available. Is there a hotline
you can call for help if the program has a problem you can't solve?
Does the company provide updated versions periodically? Are they
free or at nominal cost?</p>

<p><b>Compatibility with Hardware.</b> Is the software compatible with
hardware you already have, or does it run on an operating system you
can use with your hardware?</p>

<p>Some computers use tape cassettes, like audio tape you use on a
tape recorder. The most standard storage medium for programs and
data is the floppy diskette, which looks like a soft phonograph record.
The diskette comes in several sizes&mdash;the most common are 8 inches
and 5 inches. A newer possibility is the 8-inch hard disk. The hard
disk may be used for storage, but you buy the software on a floppy
disk and transfer it.</p>

<p><b>Memory.</b> Does your computer have enough memory to run the
program?</p>

<p><b>Recommendation.</b> Does the program come from a reputable
source, or does it come with a recommendation from someone you
trust?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span></p>

<p><b>Effectiveness.</b> Does the program do what you want it to do
correctly and consistently?</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Where_to_Look_for_Good_Software" name="Where_to_Look_for_Good_Software"></a><b>Where to Look for Good Software</b></p>

<p>Where do you find good software? Some farmers and ranchers
write their own programs or pay a programmer to write a custom
program. But most get existing programs either from State Extension
sources or from commercial outlets.</p>

<p>Many operations farmers need to perform on a computer can be
done by using generalized software packages readily available through
commercial sources.</p>

<p>Check with your County Extension Agent. He or she may know of
the programs that have been tailored for your operation. The Extension
Service has published a directory of agricultural software programs
produced by State Extension Services, entitled "Updated Inventory of
Agricultural Computer Programs."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> To order a copy, send $3.50, payable to the University of Florida, to</p>

</p>

</div>

<p>There are also various private directories of software that is
compatible for particular equipment. You can get these programs at
computer stores or through mail-order sources. Many trade journals
carry ads of agricultural software vendors.</p>

<p>The land-grant university in your State may have computer
programs available for farmers at nominal cost. Many States have
produced extensive computer software. There are also many
commercial software houses that produce computer programs in the
field of agriculture. The best programs are written by people who
combine strong expertise in the agricultural subject matter with the
ability to write good computer programs that are relatively "friendly"
or easy to use.</p>

<p>The 1980's have seen a big jump in the number, quality, and
friendliness of agricultural software. But you still need to evaluate
carefully the programs you are considering. Remember that software
selection and evaluation are important factors to consider when
planning a computer system for your farm.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Compatibility_Counts" id="Compatibility_Counts"><b>Compatibility Counts</b></a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span></p>

<p>Computers and marriages should share one thing in common:
Compatibility. If it's not there, the system won't work.</p>

<p>Not all hardware and software are compatible. In fact, hundreds
of producers of computer equipment and computer programs are in
the market, and there are few across-the-board standards. So it's
important to get hardware and software that are compatible.</p>

<p>Software, or the computer programs themselves, are not like
records that can be played on any record player. They have to be
compatible with the hardware in terms of the programing language
used, operating system, size, format, and other factors.</p>

<p>Try to find a store in your area where you will get the expertise
you need to obtain the right combination of software and hardware to
meet your needs.</p>

<p>When you buy a computer, find out whether it comes with a
standard operating language that will allow you to use a wide variety of
programs written in different languages on your computer. Even then,
you may find that a disk that supposedly works with that operating
language will not work on your machine.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Checklist_for_Evaluating_Hardware" name="Checklist_for_Evaluating_Hardware"></a><b>Checklist for Evaluating Hardware</b></p>

<p>Here are some factors to consider when evaluating and
comparing hardware:</p>

<p><b>Software.</b> The first questions to ask are, "What software do you
plan to use?" and "Which computer will run that program?"</p>

<p>Does the computer come with a standard operating system so
that it will be compatible with a range of software programs?</p>

<p><b>Memory.</b> How much memory, or information storage capacity,
do you need? The computer's memory is measured in kilobytes
(abbreviated K), and most computers come in sizes ranging from 2K up
to 256K. (A kilobyte is equal to roughly 1,000 characters.) You need to
know the software program you will use and your recordkeeping
requirements to accurately estimate the capacity of the equipment you
need.</p>

<p>Some agricultural programs use 48K or 64K of memory. User
friendly programs, which require little training to use and which guide
you through the program, may be easier; but they may require more
memory for the program itself, leaving you less storage space or
memory for the data.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span></p>

<p><b>Computation.</b> What kind of computational ability do you want
your computer to have? Will it serve the computing needs you have
identified for now and later?</p>

<p><b>Input and Output Devices.</b> What kind of output do you need?
What additional pieces of equipment or peripherals (such as separate
screen, disk drive, modem, printer) will you need to buy to make this
system do what you want it to?</p>

<p>Most agricultural programs require a printer. A dot matrix printer
(which produces characters made of small dots) may be sufficient.
Another option is a letter quality printer, which is more expensive.</p>

<p>How big a screen do you need? (Screens are measured in
characters and in inches.) Do you need an 80-column or 40-column
monitor? Do you need color and strong graphics capability? What
quality screen image do you need?</p>

<p>Can you add memory and other components later if you need to?</p>

<p><b>External Storage.</b> What kind of external storage does the system
use, floppy disk, hard disk, or tape? Cassette tape storage costs less,
but compared to disk storage, it has several disadvantages.</p>

<p>If the hardware uses floppy disks, is the disk drive included as part
of the computer package or does it come separately? Is a second disk
drive included in the package or does it come separately? What kind of
a disk drive(s) do you need, single or double density? Hard or floppy?</p>

<p><b>Training.</b> What training is available in the use of the new
equipment?</p>

<p><b>Backup and Maintenance Services.</b> What backup and
maintenance services are available from the vendor or other sources,
once you've bought this computer?</p>

<p>What happens when the computer is down (not working)? Does
the company or store from which you plan to buy offer a service
contract, and how much does it cost? Will you have to carry your
computer to their site for servicing, and how long are you likely to be
without it? How far away is your dealer and where will the computer
actually be serviced?</p>

<p>It's important to buy something that you can have fixed fairly
quickly and cheaply, since elements of your system, especially the
mechanical parts, may well need repair at some time.</p>

<p><b>Value.</b> What equipment and software programs come with the
basic package, and are these items included in the base price?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span></p>

<p>Compare prices carefully, considering the components and
software you are getting for a particular price. Do not buy on the basis
of price alone, but consider also the reliability of the equipment and
the vendor, and the service you will be getting to set up, maintain, and
support your system.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Where_to_Look_for_Good_Hardware" name="Where_to_Look_for_Good_Hardware"></a><b>Where to Look for Good Hardware</b></p>

<p>Many buyers get their computers at specialty stores that handle
computers and other electronics. Some handle only one brand of
computer. It's worthwhile to shop around and see various systems.
The big national department store chains sell computers, too. Talk to
your neighbors about what they're using, and be sure to get hands-on
practice with systems you are considering.</p>

<p>Try to find a reputable dealer who can offer backup support.
Consider the pros and cons of getting all equipment from a single
vendor versus shopping around for peripherals from different
manufacturers. A reliable dealer who handles several brands can help
you make this decision.</p>

<p>Check with your Extension office. It may have a State publication
on computers or a checklist for buying one.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Types_of_Hardware" name="Types_of_Hardware"></a><b>Types of Hardware</b></p>

<p>Farmers are using several different types of computers. Besides
the microcomputer, which is the most widely used, other kinds of farm
computers include interactive terminals, videotex terminals,
handheld processors, and minicomputers.</p>

<p>A microcomputer can be used as a stand-alone unit, working on
its own with a software disk or tape. Or it can be connected to outside
information sources if it is equipped with a device known as a modem,
which allows the computer to communicate with other computers
over the telephone. The modem turns the computer from an
information processor and storage machine into a piece of
communications equipment.</p>

<p>An interactive terminal has no data storage capability but is linked
to a central computer through the telephone. This is called a "dumb"
terminal because it can receive, display, and send information, but it
cannot process that information. Programs and data are stored in the
central computer and the user pays a fee to access the system.</p>

<p>A videotex keyboard terminal can be connected to a telephone
jack and any television set. The user can request and receive any kind
of information stored in the central computer. Some of the online
services use this type of equipment (see section about online
information systems on <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> 17 </a></span></p>

<p>Many farmers are also using handheld programmable calculators.
These are convenient to use in the field, and can record often repeated
data, such as daily milk production. They have little memory (usually
2K) and their output can be printed on 2-inch paper tape. They are
much cheaper than the microcomputer.</p>

<p>Farmers use them to record daily milk production, formulate dairy
and beef rations, estimate value of dairy forages, estimate cost of
operating farm machinery, and calculate depreciation and investment
tax credit.</p>

<p>Some very large farm operations use minicomputers, which are
larger, have more memory, can do more functions than the
microcomputers, and can support multiple users. However, the newer
microcomputers have more memory and more functions, and the
difference between minicomputers and microcomputers has narrowed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Components_of_a_Microcomputer" id="Components_of_a_Microcomputer"><b>Components of a Microcomputer</b></a></p>


<p>One way to understand how a microcomputer works is to see its
key components.</p>

<p>The <b>central processing unit</b> (CPU) is the silicon chip that is the
"brain" of the computer. It does all the computation and controls all
the other processing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span></p>

<p>The CPU stores <b>memory</b> of several kinds. Part of the memory is
wired into the computer permanently by the manufacturer. This is
called Read Only Memory (ROM). It contains such things as the
operating system and program language. Random Access Memory
(RAM) is the memory bank that includes the computer program or
instructions, as well as the data. Your storage devices&mdash;tape cassettes,
floppy disks, or hard disks&mdash;that store computer programs and data,
are sometimes called external memory.</p>

<p>The computer system also needs <b>input devices</b> and <b>output
devices</b>. Your keyboard is an input device; disk drives and tape drives
are also input devices. The output will probably be a cathode ray tube
(CRT), which looks like a video monitor. The printer is the other output
device you may choose to include in your computer system.</p>

<p>Make sure the microcomputer has an adequate number of input
and output ports for future needs.</p>

<p>If you use your computer for communications, you'll need a
telephone <b>modem</b>.</p>

<p>Here is a possible shopping list of hardware for a farmer's starting
microcomputer system:</p>

<p>CPU (computer) with 48K or 64K of memory.</p>

<p>CRT or monitor with adequate character width for the programs
you plan to use.</p>

<p>One or two disk drives, either 5 or 8 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>Dot matrix printer (optional).</p>

<p>Modem for communication with large computer (optional).</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Try_it_Out" id="Try_it_Out"><b>Try it Out</b></a></p>


<p>Be sure you try the system you plan to buy. Test run on a sample
problem the hardware and software combination you are considering
using. See if you think the solutions the computer puts out are what
you need.</p>

<p>If you insist on a thorough demonstration of the material you are
considering buying, you can evaluate it in terms of its ease of use and
the usefulness of its analysis.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of buying a new software package for a
computer you already have, ask to try it out first. Some software
distributors in the public sector will give you a trial period to make sure
the program is satisfactory and runs on your equipment. Or you may
be able to obtain a demonstration disk. At least, try out new programs
with the same microprocessor, printer, and screen you use to make
sure they will work on your equipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span></p>

<p>It's useful to have software evaluated by a reputable source&mdash;for
example your local county Extension agent, State Extension specialist,
or a neighbor who has had experience.</p>

<p>"Let the buyer beware" is a good motto to remember as you shop
around for a computer system.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="caption3"><b>Getting Comfortable with Computers</b></p>

<p>If you can use a typewriter, you can use a computer. Most
agricultural program's do not require particular math or technical
skills, just a knowledge of your farming operation and the ability
to think in a logical, orderly way. Most new programs are user
friendly; they ask you questions in plain English, and you type the
answer on the keyboard.</p>

<p>A good way to feel comfortable with computers is to try one
out at your local computer store, or at fairs, conferences, or
workshops at universities.</p>

</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Computers_Need_an_Investment_in_Time_and_Money" id="Computers_Need_an_Investment_in_Time_and_Money"><b>Computers Need an Investment in Time and Money</b></a></p>


<p>In addition to considering the cost of a computer system, consider
the time and effort it takes to learn the equipment and the programs,
and to keep records. Who will be operating the microcomputer? Does
he or she have the patience and skills to learn to operate the computer,
and to enter the large amounts of data that will be required initially?</p>

<p>The computer may save time and money. Many farmers find that
they don't save time but they accomplish more in the time they do
spend. Don't underestimate the amount of time and effort it will
require to collect data, make sure it's accurate, enter the data, and run
the analyses.</p>

<p>It's important to consider how user-friendly the computer is, and
how much the computer's software will do to guide you through the
analysis.</p>

<p>A computer will do calculations very quickly, perhaps saving
hours of laborious figuring. A computer will store information from one
time period to the next, and recalculate alternatives quickly. By making
the information available, it will help you identify strong and weak
points in your operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span></p>

<p>However, these functions will depend on your data. If the records
you use in making a computation are incomplete, for example, the
computer cannot fill in the gaps for you nor overcome inaccuracies in
the data.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Information_available_Online" id="Information_available_Online"><b>Information available Online From USDA, State, and Private
Sources</b></a></p>


<p>You can transform your own microprocessor or other computer
into a powerful communications device by adding a modem to it and
communicating over the telephone.</p>

<p>This will help you gather information on news, weather forecasts,
emergencies or disasters, crop and livestock production, and
marketing (including current and future prices).</p>

<p>Online computer services also include buying and selling farm
products; purchasing farm and home supplies, including teleshopping;
banking services; business management advice; ordering theater
tickets; information concerning farm and public policy; and personal
education and entertainment.</p>

<p>Many farmers who are computerizing their operations, as well as
others in agriculture, can use some form of online information. There
are more than 1,300 public and private information sources available
on computer. New ones seem to come out every week. The following
selected list of information you can receive on computer includes
some of the major private online information services with agricultural
applications, as well as the main ones available from USDA and the
State land-grant institutions.</p>

<p>Most of these information networks are paid for by the user based
on the amount of use. Many charge an initial fee, and then most
charge the user by the amount of time he or she spends on the system.</p>

<p>No one computer system or online system may be adequate for
everyone. There are many good systems, and different systems are
good for different tasks.</p>


<p><b>1. AGNET</b></p>

<p>AGNET is a major online information and problem-solving service
for farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses, and homes. It is sponsored
jointly by five State Cooperative Extension Services&mdash;Nebraska,

operated by the University of Nebraska. County Extension offices in
several States participate, and farmers in nearly all the 50 States and
Canada subscribe to AGNET.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21 </a></span></p>

<p>It helps people make marketing and production decisions and
solve agricultural management problems, and it provides current
information on market conditions and news items. It offers cash and
futures market reports, international market reports from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS),
reports and report abstracts from the USDA's Economic Research

Extension Service economists. Also available are electronic mail
service and electronic conferencing, which allows groups of users with
similar interests to share ideas and information.</p>

<p>Farmers and ranchers who have computer terminals with
communication capability can access AGNET. Others can tap into
AGNET through their county Extension services. AGNET subscribers
are typically agricultural lenders and bankers. Extension specialists,
farm managers, home economists, agricultural consulting firms,
farmers and ranchers, and exporters of agricultural commodities.</p>

<p><b>19. NEMA (National Electronic Marketing Association, Inc.)</b></p>

<p>NEMA offers marketing firms computerized marketing systems for
many agricultural products. It is a way of linking buyers and sellers
without having to first transport the products to market.</p>

<p>Electronic marketing enables buyers and sellers to negotiate
transactions in a public market while remaining in their own offices.
NEMA is developing several marketing systems for agricultural
markets. NEMA was developed by Virginia Tech Extension and
Research staff in cooperation with the Virginia Department of
Agriculture and Commerce and AMS.</p>

<p>Through a telephone hookup to computer terminals in any
location, buyers and sellers are brought together at a specific time to
determine the price, on a competitive basis, for the products being
offered for sale. Prospective buyers can obtain written descriptions of
the products before sale time.</p>

<p>One pricing technique is a computerized auction process, where
the computer acts as the auctioneer. During the auction, the computer
drops the asking price until a bid is received, then raises the price from
that point until there is only one bidder left. At the end of a sale, the
highest bidders receive summaries of their purchases. The products are
shipped efficiently from seller to buyer.</p>

<p>State Cooperative Extension Services, producers' organizations.
State departments of agriculture, and other agencies have developed
and implemented NEMA, as well as some other electronic marketing
systems in the United States. Today computerized systems sell
slaughter and feeder livestock, cotton, and shell eggs.</p>

<p><b>Rural Telephone Lines</b></p>

<p>One question to consider when you are selecting a
computer system to be used in a rural area is whether your
telephone line is adequate for potential users in your area. You
must have a private line. Line quality is also important; excessive
line noise or dips and surges in power may cause the
communications system to disconnect you.</p>

<p>In the future, farmers will be able to get information by
satellite rather than through the phone, which could eventually
be a cost saver for those who are far from the information
source.</p></div>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="Other_Computer_Developments_at_USDA" id="Other_Computer_Developments_at_USDA"><b>Other Computer Developments at USDA</b></a></p>


<p>Besides online information services, there are several other
computer developments available through USDA that are of use to
farmers and ranchers. Many USDA agencies are using computers to
disseminate information. Here is a partial list:</p>

<p>Since 1981, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) has been
releasing information electronically that previously had been
distributed as publications through the mail.</p>

<p>The FAS electronic information system includes agricultural trade
leads received from agricultural attaches relating to potential purchases
of commodities by foreign buyers.</p>

<p>The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), in cooperation
with the Extension Service, has developed two software packages to
help farmers make decisions about the kind and amount of crop
insurance they will need. ARCIE (All Risk Crop Insurance Evaluation)
comes in "mini" and "complete" versions.</p>

<p>Mini-ARCIE takes individual farm data and calculates a projected
cash flow under various yield conditions with and without crop
insurance. It takes about 15 minutes to run.</p>

<p>Complete-ARCIE, which takes about an hour, analyzes risk and
loss probabilities over an extended period. It prompts farmers to enter
expected prices and yields, and to include historical data.</p>

<p>Both programs examine the insurance options available&mdash;both
public and private&mdash;and show how these options compare and how
they complement each other. Federal Crop Insurance is currently
available on about 30 major crops nationwide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span></p>

<p>These programs are designed to run on most microcomputer
models. Your State Extension Service, State Vocational Education
Office, or your local crop insurance agent may already have the
programs.</p>

<p>The <b>Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service</b>
(ASCS) is planning to put small computers into all its county offices
starting in 1985. They will keep lists of farmers and their acreage
allotments and bases, record set-aside histories, and record and
maintain the other myriad facts necessary to make the USDA farm
programs work. The system will keep farm records, addresses for
mailings, election registers, and records of payments. Even checks to
pay farmers will be produced by the decentralized county computer
systems.</p>

<p>The computers will also be tied into State systems and a central
computer for some recordkeeping functions, and can be used for
electronic mail and other communications.</p>

<p>One function of the new system will be to mesh FAS trade
opportunity leads into the ASCS data base. This will permit a farmer or
local agribusiness person to go into the ASCS office and immediately
learn about trade leads reported by agricultural attaches. This program
will go into operation during the mid-1980's.</p>

<p>The <b>Economic Research Service</b> (ERS) releases its Outlook and
Situation reports through AGNET. Summaries of these are available
through USDA Online.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
